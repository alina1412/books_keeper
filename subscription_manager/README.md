### subscription_manager

**What is the purpose?**

The script helps in comparing, merging and converting lists of subscriptions of youtube.

**Why it's needed?**

When using different accounts and devices with different applications for representation of youtube client the list of subscriptions could get differ.

In some corresponding applications that I used the subscriptions could be uploaded from the file. It allows formats "json", "csv", "db". This script allows you to convert the list to one of these formats, it prints a list to the screen to make the comparison easier.

I kept the field names as ["Channel ID", "Channel URL", "Channel title"] as they were the most necessary parts for uploading subscriptions.

**How to use it?**

It's easier to put 2 files (subs_old, subs_new) into the folder util and run a program, choosing the format of the output when it's asked. Or change names of input files in the _main_ function.

if there's only "new" subscriptions, it would take it as "all new", still suggesting to save it to one of the 3 formats to the new output file
